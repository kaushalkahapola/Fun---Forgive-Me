# React Forgiveness App

This is a simple React application built with Vite that asks the user for forgiveness. The user can either forgive or not forgive. The responses change dynamically based on the user's actions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

- `App`: This is the main component of the application. It maintains the state of the application and renders either a forgiveness message or a plea for forgiveness based on the state.

- `NoButton`: This is a button component that displays a series of messages when clicked. The messages are pleas for forgiveness.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install and setup:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application in development mode.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see a message asking for forgiveness along with two buttons. If you click "Yes, Sure ! ðŸ˜Š", you will see a message thanking you for forgiving. If you click "NO !!! ðŸ˜¡", the message on the button will change, cycling through a series of pleas for forgiveness.
